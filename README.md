PlateCost 🍽️

Simple food spend insights for small restaurants

What is PlateCost?

PlateCost is a lightweight web application that helps small, independent restaurant owners understand where their food money is going by analyzing supplier receipts.

Instead of spreadsheets, accounting software, or POS integrations, PlateCost focuses on one thing only:
turning supplier receipts into clear weekly spending insights.

The Problem

Many small restaurants:

Receive paper or PDF receipts from suppliers

Track expenses manually (or not at all)

Don’t have time for detailed bookkeeping

Just want to know why food costs went up

Existing tools are often:

Too complex

Too expensive

Over-scoped for their real needs

The Solution

PlateCost allows users to:

Upload printed supplier receipts

Automatically extract item-level data using OCR

Categorize items into clear food categories using AI

View weekly spend breakdowns and plain-language insights
